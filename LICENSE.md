To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.

Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that others can access the material at a time and place individually chosen by them.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF WARRANTIES OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

Section 6 – Term and Termination.

1. automatically as of the date the violation is corrected, provided it is corrected within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.

c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.

Section 7 – Interpretation.

a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions upon any use of the Licensed Material that may lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.

b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remainder of the Public License.

c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.
